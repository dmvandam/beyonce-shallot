# pds_analysis

This folder contains the notebook <em>pds_analysis.ipynb</em> that concerns itself with the analysis of PDS 110.

1. It extracts the data and model information from Osborn et al. 2017
2. Generates a Shallot Grid if necessary
3. Performs grid cuts dependent on the measured gradients (excluding transmission changes) and the proposed Hill radius
4. Extracts the smallest disc solutions and compares these to the model fits
5. Performs grid cuts dependent on the measured gradients (including transmission changes) and the proposed Hill radius
6. Extracts the smallest disc solutions and compares these to the model fits
7. Produces the cartoon figure of the different disc solutions that fit the data (<strong>Figure 12</strong>)
8. Produces the figure showing the respective gradient evolution of the different disc solutions (<strong>Figure 13</strong>)
9. Produces the parameter histograms for PDS 110 (<strong>Figure 15</strong>).

Plots are saved in the ../figures folder.
